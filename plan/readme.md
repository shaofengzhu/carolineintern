## 3rd week

### Learn NumPy
If you get error that numpy is not defined, please run
```
pip install numpy
```
Try the following code to understand NumPy library. You could also try to write your own code to use NumPy library
```python

import numpy as np

print(np.sum([1,2,3]))

matrixA = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
vectorA = [1,2,3]
print(np.dot(matrixA, vectorA))
matrixB = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
print(np.dot(matrixA, matrixB))

matrixC = [[1,2,3], [1,2,3]]
print(np.subtract(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, 1))

print(matrixA)

print(np.array(matrixA))

```

Create your own class Matrix, which has 
```python
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.data = [[0.0 for j in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]
```

and add a few methods on it, so that you could perform dot, add, substruct operations. You will define static methods, for example
```python
    @staticmethod
    def add(matrixA, matrixB):
        if (matrixA.rows != matrixB.rows):
            raise Exception("matrix rows not match")
        if (matrixA.cols != matrixB.cols):
            raise Exception("matrix cols not match")
        
        ret = Matrix(matrixA.rows, matrixA.cols)
        for i in range(matrixA.rows):
            for j in range(matrixA.cols):
                ret.data[i][j] = matrixA.data[i][j] + matrixB.data[i][j]
        return ret
```

And then you could compare your Matrix implementation with numpy implementation.

### Perceptron
- Learn the simplest nenural network, Perceptron, algorithm and implement it using pure Python
https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-perceptron-algorithm-scratch-python/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&list=RDCMUCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw&index=4

A sample perceptron is:
```python
import random

class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, inputNodeCount):
        # initialize the weight with random number from -1 to 1
        self.weights = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for x in range(inputNodeCount)]
        # initialize bias
        self.bias = random.uniform(-1, 1)
        self.learning_rate = 0.02

    def guess(self, inputs):
        sum = self.bias
        for i in range(len(self.weights)):
            sum += self.weights[i] * inputs[i]

        # use very simple function as activation function
        # It only return -1 or 1 based on sign
        if (sum < 0):
            return -1
        return 1

    def train(self, inputsAndTargetList):
        sum_error = 0
        for inputsAndTarget in inputsAndTargetList:
            inputs = inputsAndTarget[0: len(self.weights)]
            # last element is the target
            target = inputsAndTarget[-1]
            prediction = self.guess(inputs)
            err = target - prediction
            sum_error += err* err
            self.bias = self.bias + self.learning_rate * err
            for i in range(len(self.weights)):
                self.weights[i] = self.weights[i] + self.learning_rate * err * inputs[i]
        print(f'error={sum_error}')


class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = None, y = None):
        if (x is None):
            x = random.uniform(0, 300)
        if y is None:
            y = random.uniform(0, 300)

        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        if x > y:
            self.label = 1
        else:
            self.label = -1

def train_and_predict():
    trainingPoints = [Point() for i in range(100)]
    inputsAndTargetList = [[p.x, p.y, p.label] for p in trainingPoints]

    # create a brain, who only has 2 inputs
    brain = Perceptron(2)
    for i in range(5):
        brain.train(inputsAndTargetList)

    print(f"bias={brain.bias}, weights={brain.weights}")

    testingPoints = [Point() for i in range(50)]
    correctCount = 0
    for pt in testingPoints:
        prediction = brain.guess([pt.x, pt.y])
        if (prediction != pt.label):
            print(f"Wrong prediction for ({pt.x}, {pt.y})")
        else:
            correctCount+= 1
    # print out accuracy
    print(f"{correctCount} out of {len(testingPoints)} are correct")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_and_predict()


```

### How weight/bias is updated
In the above code, for each training cycle, we will update the weight and bias to new value.
```
w0_new = w0 + learning_rate * error * x0
bias_new = bias + learning_rate * error
```
You may wonder why. It's all because we want to minimize the square of the error. Because error could be positive or negate, we use square of the error. If the square of the error is minimized, we get the appropriate weight and bias.

Suppose we have
```
prediction = w0 * x0 + w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + b
```
We will know that
```
derivative_of_prediction_over_w0 = x0
derivative_of_prediction_over_w1 = x1
derivative_of_prediction_over_b = 0
...
```

If the `target` is the actual answer. Then we know the error is
```
error = target - prediction
error_square = error * error = (target - prediction) * (target - prediction)

derivative_of_errorSquare_over_w0 = 2 * (target-prediction) * (-1) * derivative_of_prediction_over_w0
   = 2* error * (-1) * x0
```

We could then apply the gradient descent method. If the `derivative_of_errorSquare_over_w0` is positive, we should decrease w0 a little bit. If `derivative_of_errorSquare_over_w0` is negative, we should increase w0 a little bit. Let the `step_size` to be a very small number, such as 0.01, we will have

```
w0_new = w0 - step_size * derivative_of_errorSquare_over_w0

w0_new = w0 + step_size * 2 * error * x0
```

If we define
```
learning_rate = step_size * 2
```
We will have
```
w0_new = w0 + learning_rate * error * x0
```

That's why when we try to find the new weight, we will use the older weight, then plus learning_rate times error and times the input. You could do similar exercise to get the formula to update the bias.
