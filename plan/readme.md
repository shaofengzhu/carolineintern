## 3rd week

### Learn NumPy
If you get error that numpy is not defined, please run
```
pip install numpy
```
Try the following code to understand NumPy library. You could also try to write your own code to use NumPy library
```python

import numpy as np

print(np.sum([1,2,3]))

matrixA = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
vectorA = [1,2,3]
print(np.dot(matrixA, vectorA))
matrixB = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
print(np.dot(matrixA, matrixB))

matrixC = [[1,2,3], [1,2,3]]
print(np.subtract(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, 1))

print(matrixA)

print(np.array(matrixA))

```

Create your own class Matrix, which has 
```python
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.data = [[0.0 for j in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]
```

and add a few methods on it, so that you could perform dot, add, substruct operations. You will define static methods, for example
```python
    @staticmethod
    def add(matrixA, matrixB):
        if (matrixA.rows != matrixB.rows):
            raise Exception("matrix rows not match")
        if (matrixA.cols != matrixB.cols):
            raise Exception("matrix cols not match")
        
        ret = Matrix(matrixA.rows, matrixA.cols)
        for i in range(matrixA.rows):
            for j in range(matrixA.cols):
                ret.data[i][j] = matrixA.data[i][j] + matrixB.data[i][j]
        return ret
```

And then you could compare your Matrix implementation with numpy implementation.

### Perceptron
- Learn the simplest nenural network, Perceptron, algorithm and implement it using pure Python

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&list=RDCMUCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw&index=4

A sample perceptron is:
```python
import random

class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, inputNodeCount):
        # initialize the weight with random number from -1 to 1
        self.weights = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for x in range(inputNodeCount)]
        # initialize bias
        self.bias = random.uniform(-1, 1)
        self.learning_rate = 0.02

    def guess(self, inputs):
        sum = self.bias
        for i in range(len(self.weights)):
            sum += self.weights[i] * inputs[i]

        # use very simple function as activation function
        # It only return -1 or 1 based on sign
        if (sum < 0):
            return -1
        return 1

    def train(self, inputsAndTargetList):
        sum_error = 0
        for inputsAndTarget in inputsAndTargetList:
            inputs = inputsAndTarget[0: len(self.weights)]
            # last element is the target
            target = inputsAndTarget[-1]
            prediction = self.guess(inputs)
            err = target - prediction
            sum_error += err* err
            self.bias = self.bias + self.learning_rate * err
            for i in range(len(self.weights)):
                self.weights[i] = self.weights[i] + self.learning_rate * err * inputs[i]
        print(f'error={sum_error}')


class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = None, y = None):
        if (x is None):
            x = random.uniform(0, 300)
        if y is None:
            y = random.uniform(0, 300)

        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        if x > y:
            self.label = 1
        else:
            self.label = -1

def train_and_predict():
    trainingPoints = [Point() for i in range(100)]
    inputsAndTargetList = [[p.x, p.y, p.label] for p in trainingPoints]

    # create a brain, who only has 2 inputs
    brain = Perceptron(2)
    for i in range(5):
        brain.train(inputsAndTargetList)

    print(f"bias={brain.bias}, weights={brain.weights}")

    testingPoints = [Point() for i in range(50)]
    correctCount = 0
    for pt in testingPoints:
        prediction = brain.guess([pt.x, pt.y])
        if (prediction != pt.label):
            print(f"Wrong prediction for ({pt.x}, {pt.y})")
        else:
            correctCount+= 1
    # print out accuracy
    print(f"{correctCount} out of {len(testingPoints)} are correct")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_and_predict()


```

### Understand Neural Network
